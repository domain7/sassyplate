/* 
	Note:
		+ Mixin names should describe what things ARE, not what they look like.
		+ As much as it kills me, colour is spelled the American way to be consistant
		  with colour declarations in css.
	
	For example, the following are good variable names:
	$base_font, $header_font, $brand_color, $accent_color, $breakpoint-midsize, $breakpoint-small
	
	These are bad variable names:
	$blue, $orange, $helvetica, $ipad, $iphone
